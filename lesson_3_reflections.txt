When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Having a remote repository is useful in several different ways. First if you are working from multiple computers, it makes it easy to push or pull code to contribute on the fly. Second it makes it easier to share you work, either with collaborators or with other interested parties such as employers screening applicants.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.
The primary functionality of github is to store your git repositories in a location where they can be accessed from different computers. In many cases a repository may already exist that contains changes that have not yet been pushed to github. Because of the potential for this it is important for git users to control how and when they pull from a repository to avoid losing their work.
