What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The hidden git file is created that contains the information git uses to operate on this repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a place to track what work will be done with the next commit. It makes it easier to group commits logically.
